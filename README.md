# Fontend Mentor - Product Preview Card Component

My solution for the Product preview card component on Frontendmentor.io, This website has been a great source of practice for me and I highly encourage all up and coming webdevs to give it a shot. It was a bit tough getting it pixel perfect without a Figma file or exact measure but I tried my best.

## My Process and tools:

- Desktop first workflow
- Flexbox

- No libraries were used, just straight HTML/CSS
